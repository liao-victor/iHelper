# iHelper: Student Helper Management System

* To meet the demands of students to apply for new part-time jobs and manage current jobs, and the demands of staff to release the new part-time jobs and manage the part-time employees, we designed and implemented a part-time job management system for both staff and students.
* Skills applied: PHP, Oracle PL/SQL, database schema design, CSS, Apache.

The [project report](https://github.com/liao-victor/iHelper/blob/main/Report.pdf) describes how this website works in detail.
